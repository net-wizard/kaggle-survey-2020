2020 Kaggle Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Survey  
### Abstract:  
<p>      Kaggle conducted an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey was live for 3.5 weeks in October, and after cleaning the data they left with 20,036 responses. In all those responses people gave their information like what technologies they use, what is their qualification? Etc. The task is to extract useful information from the dataset by analysing and visualising. With charts, we can answer a lot of questions about the data science industry. In this project, I tried to answer ten such questions that every new data science aspirant might ask.<p>
